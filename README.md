# This is a project I have done in college using the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4 to develop policies for the Pennsylvania College of Technology. The last section, which is
data encryption, was an addition of my own to supplement what I believe was missing from the select policies we were given to work with. It is not an official part of 
the NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 4, but rather an extension of the project to demonstrate the student's capability to create their own policies within the scope of what an 
organization might need.
